## Day 2016.3.2 ##

**OK,let me have a try**

It is my **first** time to edit the file in the github,so I am a little nervous.
It is hard for me to do something cool by using computer because of less practice.

It is 23:20 now
Going to sleep early is a good habit that can make me energetic,so I decide to stop to sleep and revert tomorrow.

## Day 2016.3.8 ##
Thanks to my good friend Bi Ruike,I have installed **Linux** successful.It is my first time to run my computer without **windows**,making me so excited.After that,I learn something basic about **Linux** from Bi.I have known some very primate operation in **Linux**.

 1. *Ctrl+Alt+T*——I can open the terminal interface.In terminal interface,I can do lots of things.
 2. *sudo*——I can have root right.
 3. *sudo apt-get install+software* ——If I want to install some software,like VIM,I just need to input **sudo apt-get install vim**.
 4. *sudo shutdown now*-——I can input this command to turn off my computer very quickly.

 I know that I still am a fish and have a long way to go.Nevertheless,I have fun and want to learn more about computer recently.
